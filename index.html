          <h2>Australia Changing Temperature</h1>
          <p>over the year there has been a lot of talks about climate change and how the earth is getting hotter.
            Australia is now a part of that conversation.
            From the Temperature Map we can see that althought the hottest place, Northern Territory Temperature remain consistent to be
            the hottest state but if we look at the other states over the year we can see that on average the state around the Northern Territory has a darker
            saturation indicating that the other states are becoming hotter.    
          </p> 
          <p> 
            This is futher supported by the box plot. Although there are a cyclic distributions of data over the decades,
            it is evident that that the mean Temperature of Australia has increased over the year. The average
            temperature begun at around 20 c climbing to about 21 - 22 c.

              <h2>Irregular Rainfall</h1>
              <p> Although Melbourne weather is unpredictable there should still be some pattern in the rainfall map.
              However, there are a lot of Irregularity which is also mentioned climate change by NSW Gov. One of the causes of
              this Irregular pattern is probably due to the increase in temperature range experienced by the country. We can see
              evidence of the interquatile range of the temperature box plot becoming larger over the year.
